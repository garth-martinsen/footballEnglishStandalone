Americas Cup of English is a game for non-english speaking persons to learn and compete in learning english.
Ball advances every time possessing team answers correctly a question about english 
and opposing team answers incorrectly.
When the ball is in a goal, just after scoring, the team may advance the ball by answering a question correctly. 
There is no opportunity to stop this advancement by the other team. So basically the team with the ball continues to try
until they get a correct answer, at which time the ball will advance. 
For all other ball positions, opponent may block an advance by answering correctly a question in english.
Possessor and Opponent are asked questions until ball advances or changes direction.
Possessor loses the ball to the Opponent upon giving two incorrect answers while opponent answers correctly twice.
When this occurs the administrator presses the "Change Possession" Button which switches the Arrows to show new direction.
Three advances are required to move from opponents goal to a position from which you have a chance to score.
Scores are made/blocked by answering questions at the scoring position.
The image of the ball moves upon successful advances. 
When the administrator presses the question Button, the question is displayed in a Text area left of the field img.
A 30 second timer starts upon displaying the question. It will sound a beep and a Homer Simpson "Doh!" upon expiration.
Displaying a Response to the question will halt the timer and restart it, as will a request for another question.
Upon timeout or a response to the question, the administrator can show the answer by pressing the "show Answer" Button. 
This gives feedback to the players on the question, whether they answered correctly or not. 
The track at the bottom of the screen shows green or red for each question answered. Red indicates error, Green indicates correct. At the end of the normal questions, the red questions may be posed to the same team again until they turn green. This gives students the change to fix their mistakes.

This version of the game is standalone and does not require a server. It is written in javascript only. The questions are fetched from an array of items in a javascript function.

The important part of this game is not to win but to have fun learning english.
